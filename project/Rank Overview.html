      <h2>League Overview</h2>
      <p>Unlike Normal games where players can enjoy the game without much intense competition, Ranked games are considered as competitive matches that help measure your ladder on the server. There are in total 7 divisions in League: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Master, and Challenger. Each division has 5 tiers (I,II,III,IV,V – with V being the lowest tier in the division). If a player wins a ranked game, he/she will earn LPs. Vice versa for losing. Once the player reaches 100lp in his tier, he gets into series that will determine the promotion to next tier or division. Promotion series to higher division requires at least 3 wins out of 5 games. Promotion series to higher tier, though, requires at least 2 wins out of 3 games. On the other hand, when the player reaches 0 LP, they have a high chance of being demoted to a lower tier or division if they lose the next game(s).</p>

     <p> Bronze V is the least common division in the league, containing 700,000 players globally</p>
     <p> Bronze is considered by some players to be the hardest league to get out of, due to the high number of trolls and griefers</p>
     <p> The average KDA in Bronze is 2.29 which comes from an average of 6.37 Kills, 6.8 Deaths and 9.21 Assists.</p>
      <h3>Silver<img src="silver.png" alt="silver" title="silver" width="30" height="30"/></h3>

    <p>Gold I is the least common division in the league, with 450,000 players globally</p>

    <p>Platinum I is the least common division, with 110,000 players globally</p>
    <p>Many players consider platinum to be a highly toxic division, full of players who think they should be Diamond but aren’t quite good enough. The phrase “ELO Hell” is most commonly used to describe players stuck in Platinum5</p>
    <p>The average KDA in Platinum is 2.57 which comes from an average of 5.79 Kills, 5.61 Deaths and 8.65 Assists.</p>

      <h3>Challenger<img src="challenger.png" alt="challenger" title="challenger" width="30" height="30"/></h3>
      <p>This is only the top 200 players in each Region which means it’s a tiny percentage of the global player base.</p>
