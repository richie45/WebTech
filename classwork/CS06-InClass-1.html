		<p style="background-color:blue; font-size:18pt;">This is a paragraph. I've tried to make it long enough to scroll onto a second line. If it's still two short,
			please resize your window so that you can observe whether or not it's indented properly.</p>
		<p>This is the second paragraph. Note that it has exactly the same style as the first paragraph. You will need to
			learn how to use in-line styles or tag ids if you want this paragraph to be formatted differently from the one

			<p class="scroll">An elephant family is ruled by a matriarch (older female), and generally consist of her female 
					offspring and their young. In Africa, a basic family unit consists of six to twelve animals, but 
					families of twelve to twenty elephants are quite common. An elephant family will split depending
					on the size of the family, the amount of available food, and how well they are getting along. 
					When the matriarch dies, one of the oldest offspring takes her place. An elephant family is led 
					by a matriarch, with the matriarch being the oldest and most experienced of the herd. The matriarchal 
					society consists of her female offspring and their young. In some cases it may include one of the 
					matriarch's sisters and her offspring as well. It is this close contact and relationship allows 
					the rest of the elephant to acquire knowledge to be used when needed.</p>
