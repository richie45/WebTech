    <h1>What is your website about?</h1>

    <p>My website is going to be about the game called League of Legends(aka LOL). LOL is a multiplayer online battle video game developed by Riot Games.
        10 Players (5v5) can select champions with unique abilities and roles in the battle. The gaol of the game is to destroy enemy's Nexus which is protected by the turrets.
     </p>

     <h1>What is the objective of your website? </h1>
     <p>The main objective of my website is to get more users on League and provide them with basic instructions on how to enjoy the game. I will be providing
         basic information on each champion and tips on how to increase the win rate in a game. 
     </p>

     <h1>Who is your target audience set?</h1>
     <p>My website's target audience are mostly newcomers and newbies who just started the game; however, anyone who is interested in/plays league are welcome to view my site.</p>

     <h1>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h1>
     <p>First page is going to include basic infomration on each champion such as abilities, basic stats, and difficulty.
        The second page is going to include general rules of the game, how nexus cannot be attacked without destrying the inhibitors
        The third page will include the rank systems and brief explanation on each tier (in top percentile).
        The last page will include tips on how to get higher winrate (e.g successful teamfights and lane control etc).  </p>
